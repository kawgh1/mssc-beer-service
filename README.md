##### Part of John Thompson's Microservices course

**Beer Service** is responsible for generating the Beer objects used in the application and stores that Beer object data in a database. 
**Beer Order Service** and **Beer Inventory** make calls to **Beer Service** to get information about the Beer objects.

Beer object example:

- UUID **id** = '026cc3c8-3a0c-4083-a05b-e908048c1b08' 
- String **beer_name** = 'Pinball Porter' 
- String **beer_style** = 'PORTER' 
- Timestamp **created_date** = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
- Timestamp **last_modified_date** = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
- Integer **min_on_hand** = 12 
- Integer **quantity_to_brew** = 200 
- BigDecimal **price** = 12.95 
- String **upc** = '0083783375213' 
- Long **version** = 1

### [Java Messaging Service (JMS)](#java-messaging-service-jms)
- What is JMS?
    - JMS is a Java API which allows a Java Application to send a message to another application
        - Generally the other application is a Java application - but not always!
    - JMS is a standard Java API which requires an underlying implementation to be provided
        - For example, JPA - where JPA is the API standard, and Hibernate is the implementation
    - JMS is highly scalable and allows you to loosely couple applications using **asynchronous messaging**
    
- JMS Implementations
    - Amazon SQS
    - Apache ActiveMQ - used in this project
    - JBoss Messaging
    - IBM MQ (closed source / paid)
    - OracleAQ - (closed source / paid)
    - RabbitMQ
    - Many more!
    
- Why use JMS over REST?
    - JMS is a true messaging service
    - Asynchronous - send it and forget it!
    - Greater throughput - the HTTP protocol is slow comparatively
        - JMS protocols are **VERY** performant
    - Flexibility in message delivery - Deliver to one or many consumers
    - Security - JMS has very robust security
    - Reliability - Can guarantee message delivery
    
- Types of Messaging
    - **Point to Point**
        - Message is queued and deliver to one consumer
        - Can have multiple consumers - but message will be delivered only ***ONCE*** (ie to exactly one consumer)
        - Consumers connect to a queue
        
    - **Publish / Subscribe**
        - Message is delivered to one or more subscribers
        - Subscribers will subscribe to a ***topic***, then receive a copy of all messages sent to the topic
        
- Key Terms
    - **JMS Provider** - JMS Implementation
    - **JMS Client** - Application which sends or receives messages from the JMS Provider
    - **JMS Producer (Publisher)** - JMS Client which sends messages
    - **JMS Consumer (Subscriber)** - JMS Client which receives messages
    - **JMS Message** - the entity of data sent (see below)
    - **JMS Queue** - Queue for point to point messages. Often, not always, FIFO
    - **JMS Topic** - Similiar to a queue - but for publish & subscribe

- ## JMS Message
    - ### A JMS Message contains three parts:
        - ### Header 
            - contains meta data about the message
        - ### Properties 
            - Message properties are in 3 sections:
                - **Application** - From Java Application sending message
                - **Provider** - Used by the JMS Provider and are implementation specific
                - **Standard Properties** - Defined by the JMS API - might not be supported by the Provider
        - ### Payload
            - the message itself
            
    - ### JMS Header Properties
        - #### JMSCorrelationID 
            - String - typically a UUID. Set by application, often used to trace a message through multiple consumers
        - #### JMSExpires 
            - Long
                - zero, does not expire.
                - else, time when message will expire and be removed form the queue.
        - #### JMSMessageID
            - String - typically set by the JMS Provider
        - #### JMSPriority
            - Integer - Priority of the message
        - #### JMSTimestamp
            - Long - Time message was sent
        - #### JMSType
            - String - The type of the message
        - #### JMSReplyTo
            - Queue or topic to which sender is expecting replies
        - #### JMSRedelivery
            - Boolean - Has messaged been re-delivered?
        - #### JMSDeliveryMode
            - Integer
                - set by JMS Provider for Delivery Mode
                    - Persistent (Default) - JMS Provider should make best effort to deliver message
                    - Non-Persistent - Occasional message loss is acceptable
                    
    - ### JMS Message Properties
        - #### JSMX
            - String - User ID sending message. Set by JMS Provider.
        - #### JMSXAppID
            - String - ID of the application sending the message. Set by JMS Provider.
        - #### JMSXDeliveryCount
            - Int - Number of delivery attempts. Set by JMS Provider.
        - #### JMSXGroupID
            - String - The message group which the message if part of. Set by JMS Client.
        - #### JMSXGroupSeq
            - Int - Sequence number of message in group. Set by JMS Client.
        - #### JMSXProducerTDIX
            - String - Transaction ID when message was produced. Set by JMS Producer.
        - #### JSMXConsumerTDIX
            - String - Transaction ID when the message was consumed. Set by JMS Provider.
        - #### JMSXRcvTimestamp
            - Long - Timestamp when messaged delivered to consumer. Set by JMS Provider.
        - #### JMSXState
            - Int - State of the JMS Message. Set by JMS Provider.
                
    - #### JMS Custom Properties
        - typically where work/config about the metadata occurs
        - JMS Client can set custom properties on messages
        - Properties are set as key / value pairs (String, value)
        - Values must be one of:
            - String, boolean, byte, double, float, int, short, long or Object
            
    - #### JMS Provider Properties
        - The JMS Client can also set JMS Provider Specific properties
        - These properties are set as JMS_<provider name>
        - JMS Provider specific properties allow the client to utilize features specific to the JMS Provider
        - Refer to documentation of your selected JMS Provider for details
        
    - ### JMS Message Types
        - #### Message
            - Just a message, no payload. Often used to notify about events.
        - #### BytesMessage
            - Payload is an array of bytes
        - #### TextMessage
            - Message is stored as a string (often JSON or XML)
        - #### StreamMessage
            - sequence of Java primitives
        - #### MapMessage
            - message is name value pairs
        - #### ObjectMessage
            - Message is a serialized Java object

### [Data Source(MySQL) Connection Pooling](#data-sourcemysql-connection-pooling)
- #### Establishing a Database Connection is an expensive operation
    - Call out to Database Server to get authenticated
    - Database Server needs to authenticate credentials
    - Database Server establishes a connection
    - Database Server establishes a session - ie allocate memory and resources
    
- #### Datasource Optimizations
    - Prepared Statements: SQL Statements with placeholders for variables
        - Saves server from having to parse and optimize execution plan
        - Huge Cost Savings (performance)
        - Avoid SQL Injection attacks (security)
    - Optimizations within a single datasource connection:
        - Ability to cache prepared statements (may be at the server level too)
        - Use serve side prepared statements
        - Statement Batching (series of INSERTs or series of UPDATEs)
        
    - Datasource Connection Pooling
        - In between the Database Server and the Client exists a connection pool of existing, established connections waiting for work to do
        - When a Client Request comes in, it grabs a connection, does its work in the Database Server and then releases the connection
        - Spring Boot 1.x used Tomcat
        - Spring Boot 2.x moved to HikariCP
            - HikariCP is very light weight
            - Very high performance!
            - Hikari has a number of configuration options
            
    - Hacker's Guide to Connection Pool Tuning
        - Every RDMS will accept a max number of connections - each connection has a cost (Server memory, Server CPU, etc.)!
        - If running multiple instances of your microservice (multiple Spring Boot Contexts), keep number of pool connections lower
            - If fewer instances, can go to a higher number of connections per instance
            - Every instance you add, adds 5-10+ pool connections, and each of those connections has to be managed by the BackEnd Server
        - MySQL defaults to a limit of 151 connections
            - Can be adjusted to much higher - depending on the hardware running MySQL
        - Statement caching is good
            - BUT - does consume memory on the server
        - Disabling autocommit can help improve performance
        - **More Connections is ***NOT*** always better!**

### [HikariCP with Spring Boot 2.x](#hikaricp-with-spring-boot-2x)

- https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP
- #### Recommended settings:

    - spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=5 (relative to # of instances, server capabilities, etc.)

    - spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.cachePrepStmts=true
    - spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.prepStmtCacheSize=250
    - spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.prepStmtCacheSqlLimit=2048
    - spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.useServerPrepStmts=true
    - spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.useLocalSessionState=true
    - spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.rewriteBatchedStatements=true
    - spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.cacheResultSetMetadata=true
    - spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.cacheServerConfiguration=true
    - spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.elideSetAutoCommits=true
    - spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.maintainTimeStats=false

### [Ehcache](#ehcache)

- https://www.baeldung.com/ehcache
- Ehcache utilizes Java's on-heap RAM memory to store cache entries
- this application will use Ehcache - very popular, robust and one of the top Java caching managers
- will add caching layer for listBeers, getBeerById and getBeerByUpc  - Ehcache is a good candidate because the beer information isn't going to change that much
- ### what it will do?
    - provide fast access to the Beer data while avoiding a call to the database 
    - significantly improves the performance of our getBeer APIs
    - here we set it up to only run when we are NOT getting BeerInventory information (conditional caching)
        - because inventory is dynamic and changes often and quickly
        
- each running instance is going to have its own local cache, so if you have 3 instances running you have 1 in 3 chance of getting a cache response
- there are technologies available where instances can share a cache 
- Ehcache can be configured so that if you do have multiple instances running, it reads from a single cache

### [Spring MVC REST Docs](#spring-mvc-rest-docs)
- #### **What is it?** A tool for generating API documentation from controller tests
- Developed by Andy Wilkinson of Pivotal
- Spring REST Docs hooks into controller tests to generate documentation snippets
- ***Idea being - as soon as your controller tests fail, your API Docs fail also, so there's no delay***
- The snippets are then assembled into final documentation via AsciiDoctor
- Test Clients Supported:
    - Spring MVC Test
    - WebTestClient (WebFlux)
    - REST Assured
    
- Spring REST Docs supports the following testing frameworks:
    - JUnit 5, JUnit 4
    - Spock
    - Test NG (additional configuration required)
    
- Default Snippets
    - curl-request
    - http-request
    - http-response
    - httpie-request
    - request-body
    - response-body
    
- Spring REST Doc Options
    - Can optionally use Markdown rather than AsciiDoctor
    - Maven and Gradle may be used for the build process
    - You can package the documentation to be served as static content via Sping Boot
    - Extensive options for customizing AsciiDoctor output
    
- Third Party Extensions

    - restdocs-wiremock - Auto generate WireMock Stubs
    - restdocsext-jersey - Enable use of REST Docs with Jersey's test framework
    - spring-auto-restdocs - Use reflection to automatically document request and response params
    - restdocs-api-spec - Generate OpenAPI 2 and OpenAPI 3 specifications
